1,"I wish I could rate this app 0 stars, stop fake marketing y'all. Like that's insane , I suggest anyone reading this to not download it ! It's basically a fraud, in various ads they'll tell you 500 off on 865rs product if you wanted to redeem it you have to download the app and once you done it boom they'll tell you oh no! That's not available in this product, you have to shop above 1799 to apply this coupon. If that's the case don't show your banners that's it don't manipulate people out here.",1
2,"I ordered for the very first time from this app. Worst experience. Few items were missing from my order. When i had put in tha complaint all they could say was to return the package which was not feasible as i was not expecting that items would be missed. It has never happened with other websites n beauty apps, no matter how big the order was.",1
3,"The worst app ever!!!! Pathetic!! looks like scam!! First of all they delivered the wrong product. When I contacted them, they told me to return the product. I returned it. Then days after days passed and they didn't give the refund amount. Every time I contacted customer care service, they said to wait for 2-4 days and then after that it use to show refund failed. Then I contacted again. Again they said the same thing & this went on in loop!!!! But they don't give my money back!!!!",1
4,"Not even a single star ! The Same unresponsive, unreliable, laid-back Typical Reliance customer service. Same as their other vertical Zivame. Prepaid orders will get canceled and duplicate products are shipped. Try Returns and they will delay by asking for product images till the window date for return expires and then refuse . Typical Substandard service.",1
5,"Tira app seems an interesting app however it is poor in service. The products are missing in packages. Customer care does not resolve the concerns. However they give an irrelevant advices on the problem,apart from our actual problem. I,personally had a bad experience ordering on this site fir first time. I don't recommend this app to anyone.Since there are better applications in market,providing better services and satisfying product delivery. Practically,they are poor in service.Wrong delivery",1
6,Has the worst glitches and the customer support is pathetic. A day before my order was supposed to arrive they just cancelled it and when I asked the customer support for help they said that I had to reorder. The exact products I had ordered went out of stock and the next time I went to support they just closed the chat in between. A very pathetic first experience with such a reputed brand.,1
7,The app isn't working I ordered an eyeshadow palette and it came damaged in transit. The return menu doesn't work and keeps telling me to try later. There is no option to contact anyone. I am very disappointed and wouldn't suggest anyone to buy products from Tira. *Update* After emailing Tira multiple times and constantly sending them proof of the damaged product and sending many emails. Even after 7+ days. They haven't replied or solved my problem. Pls don't buy from them and waste your money.,1
8,Horrible service!! Would never order nor recommend anyone to use this app. the delivery was delayed by 6 days and no action was taken by the customer service even after registering multiple complaints. the delivery person kept hanging up whenever I tried to call (got the number from the automated SMS service) or would tell me the package isn't with him. I prefer the existing online stores like Nykaa instead of this it is a pure waste of time. uninstalling it right away!,1
9,"The service is trash and so insincere, i tried to return the products and one of them was wrong too but even after I sent the email many times with pictures i only got ai generated answers saying that they didn't understand my concern, i initiated the return nearly 6 days ago and there is no proper reply even the option chat with an agent seems fake everything is a scan please don't use this people this is a total scam and trashy app.",1
10,"Terrible customer support. Refund not received. I have never had such experience in any online shopping sites. Tira customer support do good lip service. Ticket raised get closed without resolution. Nearly 2 months since returning I'm yet to get full refund. Weekly I have to call. Displayed items and delivered differ. Anything free mentioned, they won't give. If you complain, nothing will happen. Tira support can do mechanical things, can't think or provide solutions. It's like talking to robot.",1
11,"The app is very slow. Takes a loooong time to refresh. Options are limited. Moreover every time you come out from the App, the login details go away. You hv to give your credentials each time.! What's the need in coming up with such App, if it's so frustrating to operate",2
12,Placed my order on tira on 29th of Oct. It's already past my due for delivery. My order is not yet delivered. I ordered it as a gift for someone and now it's a disaster since the delivery it taking forever. The customer care has not been helpful as well. The app shows that my order is at the nearest delivery hub since days. Cannot raise tickets or get help. Limited options. Definitely not using this app again in the future. Edit: coustomer care service keep ending conversation. No one responds.,1
13,A very bad experience with such growing platform for the first time. I'm a regular prive customer of nykaa since ages and it has always been the best experience. But this was the 1st time I went with ur app since my friends and colleagues suggested me to do so. When I carted a decent amount of around 2.8k-2.9k in my acc. I went ahead and chose apply coupon and it was so bad that even aftr displaying so many coupons none of them were working. Worst experience. Ws8 of time and efforts. Dont fool??,1
14,"Last month I ordered from Tira 4 products, out of which 2 I have returned 1. Serum - Pilgrim 2. Oil - Soulflower I returned it but didn't get a refund. I tried connecting on call they said they would refund me in 2 days and so on. It is been 15 days since I have been struggling. I kept mailing, I shared the delivery numbers tickets 10 times( what I got, we were closing tickets) It was a bad experience buying from tira. Worst policy, I am still struggling to get my money back Worst",1
15,Where the heck is the search option in the app? One just has to scroll for different options! Can we not get straight to the point and search for products that we want!!! Very poor app drafting!',1
16,worst site ever. it's been 25 days I haven't received my order. their customer support just keeps on saying to wait. they are not even giving tracking order details. I spend 4000 on it. don't know if they plan to send me my order ever. plz don't order from this site. nyka and purple are so much better than this,1
17,"Very pathetic service I ordered lakme highlighter in the shade ""rose gold"" and I was delivered shade ""Ivory"". Sadly the invoice bill I received with the package is also showing shade ""Ivory"" and my order history in the app is ""Rose gold"". On issuing a return request with pictures of both the bill and the product received, they are asking me to attach more pictures. This basic problem and that has been done from their side, they are troubling the customer. Still the problem is not resolved.",1
18,"Services are not well provided. In context of placing order, initiating returns, applying coupon every thing is very slow, basically you can't do anything on this app. And specially how they tend to ignore customer's problem.",1
19,"Most disgusting app I ever come through, I ordered a product it was completely damaged, it took me more than 25 calls to get the pick up done , it took them more than month to take a pickup of the damaged product, all they know is to raise unnecessary 'tickets ' no solution then it took them another 1 month to process the refund. Pathetic service, in addition I have to even face the unacceptable mood and behaviour of their delivery partner, I will never in my life will recommend this app.",1
20,"The worst app.I ordered few items which were supposed to come twice,i received my 1st order and it was good and I felt happy coz it was my 1st time ordering from Tira.but the 2nd batch was too late and they said us to collect from the place which was almost 14 km far and they said delivery not available for our place.so I requested dear Tira app to mention whether delivery is available or not to our place before accepting our order. Thank you.",1
21,"There will offer and once you go for payment, it shows you can't proceed with the offer. I have tried all payment method for all it shows the same thing. And there is no proper service and it's slow.",1
22,"I placed my first order and its been more than 15 days its not delivered yet. There is no proper customer service to address the issue, horrible experience. I'm never ordering from this app again I'll stick to Nykaa and purplle. You guys need to focus on delivering the service you promise instead of spending so much on marketing. Very much disappointed!!",1
23,"Useless and kinda fraud app. No customer support available. They assure for return and exchange but practically they delete the order and return request from their plateform. Cheap products are with higher price. Non reliable, fraud app. So be aware before installing this app.",1
24,"This is the worst app I ever used , customer care is pathetic, I have tried to place request just on the next day I receive the package , multiple request, mails , literally Not a single reply from their side.. The amount of money you are spending on PR and advertising better to use it on your customer service.",1
25,"The application's service was disappointing. I ordered multiple items, but during my second delivery, the courier man asked for Aadhaar card, signature, and even my mobile number which was soo risky. This wasn't part of the process. I had to comply due to a prepaid order, risking my privacy. Please review your procedures; such demands shouldn't be made. I wanted to inform you to verify and rectify this issue.",1
26,Tira is a nice app for your shopping needs. It provides nice discounts with a large variety of products. Products stock in frequently so you are never out of stock. It is worth shopping with.,5
27,"Worst app. Their customer support is very poor. I ordered cc cream bronze and they delivered beige shade of Lakme. I tried to escalate the issue on their app, and entered all the details with photo of the product. But it's not getting submitted. Customer care number is also not their, from which you can raise a complaint. So think twice before buying products from here.",1
28,Love the app and the range of products. I was so confused on where to order from since I have stopped using Nykaa because of a few bad experiences and knowing that some of their products aren't original. Came across Tira and loved everything about the app. Keep up the good work!,5
29,"Worst app ever don't fall for the discount. It took them 4 5 days just to process the order and 7 days to deliver . ( the longest time any app took to deliver ) . Than when I returned , it's 7 days since I requested a return but it's not yet processed.....even the support team takes ages to respond. Worst experience ??",1
30,"App is good, interface is good, but everytime I close it and open again, my cart gets empty. Also I'm unable to checkout as it says login required but I'm already logged in. If you could please suggest a solution to me or maybe fix it if it's a bug. Otherwise the app is BANG ON!!",3
31,I had placed an order for 9 items 4 days ago and only one of those items have been shipped yet. The remaining 8 products HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN PROCESSED OR SHIPPED YET. I tried contacting customer support a million times but they refuse to be of any help. I spent my hard earned money on this order and now I have no idea what to do. I would suggest TO NEVER SHOP from this app as this smells highly of FRAUD. They will lure you with offers and CHEAT YOU.,1
32,"Product not delivered and marked as delivered. There's nothing you can do. No OTP is sent before delivery. No calls are made and orders are handed over to some random people and marked as delivered. Looking at other reviews here, I'm not the only one... I think they run a scam.",1
33,The shopping experience is extremely smooth and offers a wide range and variety of products. The products which aren't available anywhere can be found on Tira and not to miss at great offers. I sincerely hope that Tira doesn't become like Nykaa that once it gains humongous popularity it forgets its loyal customers,5
34,Very very bad experience...will never order from tira it's been 10 days since I placed an order and there is no news of it . To top it all there is excellent customer support which will provide half resolution,1
35,"I only purchased once and experience was not upto the mark. Delivery was good, delivered early. I think App is not user friendly like other apps in this industry. Not showing detailed order details & tracking the pakage was missing.",2
36,"Really bad service, 9 days since order placed, still not shipped. Update: Order cancelled by Tira after 12 days, no specific reason. Product is still in stock and I can add upto 6 of those (max limit per customer). Pathetic customer experience and even worse customer support.",1
37,"Ordered for the first time with tira and had the worst experience.the order is not showing can\'t track no history they raised ticketa but never call to resolve or to follow up for the issue...just so pathetic if you want fast delivery hassle free experience and good customer service never ever choose"" TIRA ""'",1
38,"The order takes forever to get delivered. Other apps like nykaa are better alternatives if you want a quick delivery. There's no point of waving off 500 rs on orders above 1799 when all the products are on MRP, same products would cost you the same at other apps too as they already give discount on MRP. no discount as such, limited brands and products. The call centre and help section is totally a mess and a waste. No proper customer support system is there.",2
39,It's a very worst experience with you. I ordered 3k rupees of product but I get a one different product and another one missing. Their customers support team denied to return or refund my product. It's really ghatiya service and their executive are too arogant. Please don't buy anything from tira to waste your money. Their products are expensive compare to another shopping apps.,1
40,This app take forever to open. Whenever I try to click on my order it shows something is wrong. The amount you have spent on advertisement should have been spent on developing this app.,1
41,"I tried to apply the coupon but due to a net issue my payment didn\'t go through. When I tried again, it said that my coupon has been ""consumed"". Don\'t think that\'s how coupons work, probably a technical issue, please look into it.",3
42,I am writing this review after getting highly disappointed with thier services. I was under impression that this app is much better than Nykaa or other beauty app but very sorry to say that the way they are handling my grievance is beyond my imagination. I had ordered products worth 4 to 5k from this app and recieved the items except one product to which I had written them but they are not addressing the issue instead just harassing me like anything. Im never gonna order from this app now.,1
43,"Worst experience ever Never going to use it. My entire package had missing items I didn't get any product I ordered nor did I get my money back. Customer care is not helpful too. No proper solution was provided to me even after talking to them so many times on chat, on phone call and even on email. I am really disappointed as a first time user I was shocked that things like this never happened with me before. These guys are cheaters. They ate my money .. I should have stick to nykaa only.",1
44,"I have very bad experience in this site I have ordered insight lipstick which was broken so I returned it along with Maybelline black kajal on 12 oct but still my refund was not initiated for these two products. It has been 11 days now from the day of my return. To get any updation regarding return or refund i have to call customer service again and again. Their customer representative only answer to wait . no updation get from their side through email, text or not even from their tira site.",1
45,"The app need to function properly. After some hours the orders are not showing. Then after reinstallation , the orders are showing. This proplem is happening continuously. Kindly improve.",2
46,"It seems all fraud vendors are onboarded here as other websites cancelled their registration??. I received a emply box of my product, the packet was sealed but when I opened the bottle it was filled only 25%. I requested my money back but not sure that they are going to refund it or not.",1
47,"TOTAL SCAM. Wish I had checked the reviews before which clearly shows they are outrageously looting customers. Been weeks order never got delivered nor did ever receive any shipping update. Their own app shows it's canceled from the merchant's end, their DP confirmed the same. Yet after repeated complaints they refuse to pay back the money disregarding every proof you see in their own portal & parroting same lines that they are working on it.They neither delivered nor refunded. Absolute FRAUDS.",1
48,Good app.... But really have few varieties... You don't have too much options ?? whatever I searched isn't available... When I searched Mars highlighter they only show me 1 option and that also not latest one...,3
49,"Very very bad service, I used the 1st time order coupon, but for some network issue the payment was not successful and so the order was not placed. After that I tried again but they show the coupon was consumed.! Very bad experience , after that I tried to delete my ac from tira, but the app sucks, after some try, Able to delete, not recommend at all..! Disgusting!'",1
50,"I have placed an order for many product, 3 product I have received damaged, and i am unable to placed an return request it's showing error I am unable to placed an return request using app, and I have connect to customer care executive many times but I have received any help from them, I am marking emails every day, but no support from them, Worst application no help getting from tira",1
51,"Worst experience, Worst agents worst reply worst delivery. My product is delayed about 2 days. When I contact them they didn't take any action about that. They only told delivered soon or some thing like that. If you want product on correct estimated date plz order from another apps.",1
52,"Poducts are authentic there is no doubt in that.. but please change your courier partner. Bluedart is a worst courier service, my order gets delivered within 1 week. But this bluedart is taking forever to deliver my order, It's been 8-9 days its showing network issues while tracking my order. Please change your delivery partner, bluedart is the worst.",3
53,Worst apps ever... I hve order for the first time on TIRA on Nov 17..EDD was on 30th Nov .. I cant even track my order during this period n got cancel on 1st Dec without any reason... Poor in customer support.. Wont recommend..,1
54,Worst customer service... Received package with missing product same day I complaint and send them all pictures.. it's being more than 10 days still I m waiting for response.. and the said they need more time to investigate.. I got scammed here so please don't order from this app very slow and pathetic survice..,1
55,Worst app ever. Pathetic service. I ordered for the first time and got the wrong product and now they are not responding well. No one should ever buy products from this app. This app is a whole scam. Someone should do about this',1
56,I received my order which I order through app but I need to replace or exchange 1 product however I unable to login in app I am not getting otp to login and no customer support Is available. I am helpless rite now.,1
57,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I ordered 4 items(Rs 2500)out of which one was missing. I got the order on 23rd Sept. And I found a serum missing. I reported abt it immediately. The order took two days to show ""delivered"". I have been chasing the team since then. There is a constant "" we will get back to you"" response. The customer service is incompetent. Today is 7th October and I received a mail saying refund is not possible without any proof. THEY ARE SCAMMING INNOCENT PEOPLE. DON\'T BUY FROM TIRA.",1
58,lovely and quick shopping app would recommend. amazing shopping experience and nice discounts. very happy with it',5
59,"Frustration Galore! I can't express enough how deeply disappointed I am with this app. It's a glitchy nightmare that's taken my patience to its limits. But that's not the worst part. I needed to return a product, & reaching out for support through the app has been an exercise in futility. It's like shouting into a void. No response, no acknowledgment! I wouldn't recommend this app to my worst enemy. It's beyond frustrating when an app can't even handle something as basic as returns",1
60,"They are total frauds, sent me a completely damaged product (lipstick package without the lipstick worth ?1850/-) never updated the delivered status so that I can return it!! After several calls and emails (every single day twice morning and evening for a week) they finally updated the delivered status but took the product and never updated the picked up status so that I can get a refund, after calling & emailing for another 2 week everyday, they updated that, now still no refund after 4 weeks!!'",1
61,"Disgusted with the service! This is for the very first order I placed with Tira. Customer service sucks, the reps for Tira are extremely incompetent. I've sent multiple requests for a return with replies from different reps via email asking for the same thing over and over and over! The number provided via email is incorrect, I've asked for someone to call but they still send emails only asking for information about the product I'd like to return, information I've already given! Just BADSERVICE!",1
62,"Downloaded it as they have great faces and ambassadors . But the application is too slow, takes a lot of time to load the pages . Also some shipments are delayed ; my experience of very first order from tira beauty.",1
63,"Received a damaged product and since a month they are just sending me the same mails through different executives each day with no solution to the problem, returns facility is way too bad. Please opt for a better online store as there are many options available.",1
64,If you don't want to process the COD orders in time what is the point of having that option? Two days have gone by and it still simply shows processing not even confirmed! You are aware that there are much better companies out there right? I was so excited but will not shop again.,1
65,Need to improvement in app.. before I buy I check how to use* which country product is expire date. Every thing..but it seems app is not easy to use',2
66,Not able see anything in my order section. Added new address but it has taken older address. Not able to update anything as everything is showing something went wrong.,1
67,"Pathetic App. Doesn\'t have any option for searching any product. Edit: 26.11.2023: It still doesn\'t have the ""search"" option. I don\'t know why the developers haven\'t added basic search facility on the app.",1

72,Delayed deliveries. The app doesn't update the delivery date. My order was delayed by 20 days. And they care a damn about customer experience. Would always stick to Nykaa henceforth,1
73,"I ordered and my shipment status is not updated. Showing same status for past 10 days. I'm not sure whether I will get my products or not, how long I need to wait for my products. Ordered for the first time and it was not a good experience for me.",2

Instead of focusing on Celebrity endorsement, if you would have worked on Product & Cx support, it would have been better. Never gonna use it.",1
82,I'm unable to open your application. Not a single data is visible. If the app performance is low then why you do too much promotion for it?,1

Now after FINALLY getting the return through, they claimed that they would give me the refund in 2-3 days. It has now been 8 days with no refund. Never order from Tira Beauty unless you want to be scammed'",1
103,I found this App absolutely fantastic. I would earlier buy my face creams from Nykaa which never had once offered any discounts at all though I have always been buying on their platform. However I had the opportunity of buying twice on Tira and also obtaining good discounts along with samples too. But would request Tira to offer samples with good quantity moving forward.,5
104,"Most disgust app ever I have ordered some items and now it is not showing my tracking by showing some errors , this app is waste of time and money do not buy any product.....??'",1
105,"I found the app. good. But the interface need to be more simplified. When we click a product, the concern and description should be more in detail. Also you should highlight features like pregnancy safe, non comedogenic. Because nowadays people look for skin concern related products. Also you should start a section for testers and mini sample products. That wil attract more customers.",4
106,"I bought a product which had a good offer and discount ,also great delivery but The app doesn't have the search option which is basic thing and most irritating. The interface is not good for app. Sometimes get struck. App functionality is not good",3
107,"Edit - Do not order from this app unless you're willing to waste time and money. Order was placed on 25th July, did not confirm until I followed up, then delayed delivery for which I had to follow up again & then delivered old stock (foul smelling), refused to accept return. Finally they accepted return on 8th Aug, & it's been 10 days. I've followed up every single day & yet return pick up hasn't been arranged & money has not been refunded. Everyday I call, they only say they're working on it.",1
108,I have ordered for the 1st time ...Few item in the package were missing...its been 8 days u people didn't do anything about it...Only saying mail us and no answers after mail...What the hell... Don't buy anything from this app they are fraud,1
109,"Very good,i ordered 2products in website after i installed app and loggedin the app was too fast in getting the order details from website to app.Also by using coupons i got the 2products in very low price'",4
110,One of the worst app... After raising the return Request order is missing in the order list. There is a lot of performance issues and worst application',1
111,Takes too much time to load the pages. Exhausting. Please check the performance issue.,1
112,"I ordered a lisptick and it had return option. After repeated mails and calls,its everytime assured that there will be a resolution from past 3 weeks but there isnt one. Highly dissappponting!'",1
113,Shopping experience via app is pathetic. Tells me to login again everytime I try to place an order and the cart keeps getting empty even I add the products for purchase. Number of brand products are comparatively less as of now. Need to fix app issues asap.,3
114,Everything I liked about tira.but i think delivery should be more faster..i get my order after 15 days.product was little damage it was a shampoo bottle.but i didn't complain about it.to make tira more better i think this service should be better.,5
115,Fake production ???? I ordered a makeup revolution blush palette and pay the amount but in the history of order there are no history shown. I want my money back either product',1
116,"I had received parcel with leakage issue. The shampoo conditioner combo had leakage issue. External packing was untampered, so Tira had sent product which was already leaking.",1
117,"The app has been made so user friendly. The products are so nicely catergorized. It's not at all messy , to find what u exactly looking to buy.",5
118,I recently placed an order and I couldn't see the order details in my orders. There are so many glitches in the app. Not worth the hype. Expected so much but it's not worth it.,1
119,I've tried so many times but the app just not opening. It kept showing something error. Even updating can't fix it!?,1
120,"Very stupid app doesn't work at all, Even if the network is full it say something went wrong. What a useless app.",1
121,"App is not working, on opening, it is just white screen even after updating.",1
122,Bad experience 1st time I ordered pac foundation from this app and they send me broken and damage product still waiting for refund never ever ever order ... Nykaa is best bcoz they never do this to me they don't deserv 1star,1
123,The picture quality of the products cpuld have been better. Also please add more discounts/ coupons for different brands.,4
124,It hangs a lot. Not many pictures are available related to products like a sort of demo photo or video. It would give a reassurance to buy. Before losing any money.,2
125,Not even placed the order but such a poor app not even search bar available to search products this is so waste of time for one single product I have need to scroll and scroll and still unable to find',1
126,Horrible experience! Stop the fake advertisement if you can't get the products delivered to the customer. All these so called attractive offers and promo codes are of no use because at the end Tira will drop a mail saying that the product has not been shipped that it will refund the amount. Fake ads!.,1
127,"Low class application. I ordered a lipstick from it and it was of poor quality but they refused to returned the order , I mailed them continuously but no response nothing and the product describe easy returns within 15 days.I haven't got my refund yet and neither I can use the lipstick due to it's worst condition. I recommend not to use this app or to purchase anything from it.",1
128,"Looking at the reviews and people having horrible experience with this app as even after payment they are not receiving their products. I have decided to not to order anything as for middle class people money is very important and it should be spent on the service which is secured. Rather than having lucrative offers nd loosing money , it's better to spend on something which actually u can use the product",1
129,Worst app ever..i ordered for 88 ml neutrogena sunscreen but you guys have delivered 80ml.. return request has been given..trying to track..but it shows something went wrong since 2 days..worst experience ever..no response from you irresponsible people',1
130,Horrible. Takes too much time to deliver and there is no tracking option also. Not gonna shop from here again',1
131,Actually one problem is there. Here shelf life is mentioned but not mentioned expiry date. If this is metioned then it would be final destination of beauty shopping app. Actually i have lost my money for purchasing products. Discount is high when i purchased and received my product i got almost 6monthes i can use. But shelf life is mentioned 3years. This is scam. If expiry date are not mentioned then i shall not order any product.,1
132,"Worst customer experience. I applied the coupon for a product, but they cancelled the order without calling me and now that the coupon is wasted, they are not even helping me with another coupon.",1
133,DON'T DOWNLOAD Useless app. It just WON'T work. Keeps loading and then asks you to retry. USELESS app.,1
134,One of the worsttttttt app I've ever seen. Doesn't show your order status after you've placed your order,1
135,Bad customer service..the date of delivery been postponing. I raised ticket. No1 has called me in past 24 hours. This is last time am purchasing from you!!!! And yeah I have emailed to feedback mail . Update : you responded the exact thing I know. Nothing new! That delivery is in transit.,2
136,"This is more like scam do not trust this app, it doesn't have customer support services, no way you will get support on your order if you need one. If you still want to order pleas e select cash on delivery as that way you can at least save money if the product is not delivered which is highly likely.",1
137,Worst app one product missing in my parcel and I complain already 1 month passed always they said we are working on it no costumer support no one listen no costumer number no any response I mailed so many times I raised tickets they read and closed the chapter only one answer pass one month we working on it',1
138,A very slow application every time I have to log in and when search something current page shows blank white nothing work need to be improve',1
139,Very convenient and good discounts. I also love the point system best in this App',5
140,Even the product is good. The delivery time is too high take more than week',3
141,"Worst service ever, it's much better to order from nykaa. The delivery for some simple items took 15 days, no good offers and poor customer service. The products were very old and the mascara I received had dried down. Never coming back to this app.",1
142,"Never buy anything from this website, i ordered Bobbi Brown face base which was not on discount even, they gave me 500 off on my first order and I got duplicate product. The texture and fragrance of the product is totally different which i used earlier. These companies comes with tempting offers just to catch the market of loyal online sellers. Such a shameful act.",1
143,Orders taking more than a month to get shipped. I ordered mine on the 10th of October and it still hasn't been shipped yet.,1
144,"Exceeded expectations. I've placed orders multiple times and everytime I've received them within 5 days. The product variety is one of the best. Also, the app interface is one of the nicest I've ever seen. Highly recommend.",5
145,"I want to order some products. At check out when I apply coupon code it shows message ""Login requires to apply this coupon"" But I am already logged in'",1
146,Very nice collection and discount ??..fast delivery..must buy from tira',5
147,I got product in broken condition. Plzz send the products in good manner. Also delivery time too long',1
148,Wrost beauty application. I received a damaged item instantly called the customer service and didn't receive any help,1
149,"Please add more variety of lower to higher end makeup & skincare brands. However in this app, there are very less products overview. Overall this app is good and user friendly. Please keep updating!!??'",3
150,Easy search and a huge variety of products and a one stop shop for multiple beauty brands.,5
151,Items were delayed for more than 10 days. Horrible customer service. Never using it again.,1
152,It's not as sorted as other apps. Tira also doesn't extend significant discounts.,2
153,Worst ever UI you can't add more than 2 quantity of the same product.,1
154,Worst experience.. don't buy from them They send damaged products and later thy wil have long process. Customer care sucks . Don't buy from this cheaters Nykaa is better. Send damaged products in the name of discount,1
155,Love that Tira has brought in some interesting brands. Plus the offers seems very enticing too! I hope Tira does well! <3',5

161,Worst app ever.. I was ordering for the first time but when it came to the confirmation neither my order was placed nor I could use the Tira coupon.. Very bad experience!',1
162,Worst online app ever to order products. They are giving discounts on faulty products and selling them so that customers will loose their money. The product which is faulty in Design are given with discounts. Looting the people's money and doing so much drama to accept the return requests.,1
163,"Wrost service ever they sent wrong products and when it's a time to return they don't do anything. Also customer service is wrost . Its been 5 days and still they will not picked my product even after so much of information, don't know what they want. Very slow staff , very slow management, return policy is wrost and slow.",1
164,"Returning issue, bad customer service, they will advice u to go by tira mail and raise your complain with screen shot, failed link, . No returning option on my tira app, very, very bad experianced , not trusted app????'",1
165,Interface is not very catchy... Font is small.. Should be a bit bigger.. Basically its really simple.. It should be a bit flashy',3
166,I am deleting this app I have not purchased anything from this app I just downloaded this application saw that it has all high budget product I cannot afford it also my requirement is not so high I don't use much products on my skin why to waste money on such things which will harm skin in future as well as it is supperrrr costly,1

My experince with this app is good and recently i order my first order i am sure it will come good only thanku?????'",5
168,No discount. The coupons are just useless as the price is calculated with the direct MRP and minimum spend amount is too much. The other beauty apps r better',1
169,Experience is very bad..Very very bad site..fake discount and product. I am tried to complete checkout process lot of time but all time is failed. After that I found that all discount is gone after 2 -3 hours effort to checkout. Reliance is not reliable brand.,1

176,"Overall, good experience, verified product got on discounted price.",5
177,I didn't use any coupon but they said that the coupon was consumed and charged extra(without discount). Had to use a different coupons and spend more. Nykaa is way better. This app is fraudulent.,1

189,Product range and discounts are all good But I have to log in with OTP every time I open app It auto log out ....!!!',5
190,"App is too slow , and can't apply coupon, they just lie",1
191,Plz bring lakme and other products too. Bez we are not aware about international products more.,4
192,"New and fresh products, brands which are otherwise not easily accessible'",4

211,Collection is very less. Basic products are not there in the list. Its just a hyped app because of good advertising and celebrity appearance. Nykaa is far better app. Going to delete Tira. Not satisfied',1

215,Very good app to be honest.. with soo many discounts available I feel it's better than nykaa..the problem I faced was my cart got emptied thrice and I had to log in again and again please fix this bug,4
216,"Great job. A lot of brands are there. But. There are only few really good and effective skincare brands. That's a pity. Please try to bring in The Ordinary, Paula's Choice, The FormulaRx, Beauty of Joseon, iUNIK, Cerave and new indian owned brands that are showing potential like Put Simply, Cerene, if you wanna ace your competitors.",3
217,"my product came empty, they refused to refund and is not helping either. Very bad app. Never ever shop from here. I have called, emailed and raised queries multiple times. They are just not helping'",1
218,They don't have proper discounts. As basic as Nykaa and Purpelle. I really don't get the value creation this app is trying to do. Just a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox.,1
219,I really trusted the app but it was a complete failure the serum i received this morning came in a yellowish colour with a stinking smell i used my discount coupon for ordering it and it was also on sale period i thought it was a good opportunity of getting at a low price now there return policy says my coupon once used can't be used again like wow its the company fault for sending product which has gone bad there chat service is really so worse no one is helpful no one ans wht is asked worse ap,1

259,I love this app as they offer discounts and free gifts too',5
260,"Everything is out of stock on this app. Whatever I searched for, its not in stock. Nykaa is far far better than this app. When you are new in business, you need to cater quickly as per the customer's demand. Reliance is very renowned company so this was very disappointing!",1
261,Doesn't have sizes of the product. Very limited brands available. App is not user friendly,2
262,The collection of brands and products seems fine but the offers and coupons don't work. I like Nykaa better.,2
263,Do not use this application. I am facing a lot of trouble with return from last 10 days. There team is not professional neither the website. Don't even send free gifts sometimes. They keep you waiting and telling you it would be done. I had talk with most of their team so far. If you are 200% sure to keep the product you can think to use tira. Else even if you have 1% doubt don't use this website. Sort of scam only,1
264,"Worst app ever, ordered a blow dry brush and it showed an offer for a detangling hair brush free with the purchase, which I did not receive, the customer care's response took me aback- they said place a return request, the product ran out of stock, no responsibility taken and simply said it might be out of stock and hence was not delivered. So, before placing the order you have to consider - what if the product runs, out of stock. Terrible.",1
265,The worst online shopping app I have ever seen. By mistake i put the wrong mobile number so they didn't deliver me the product. Then i contact the customer care they said to that i can cancel the order as i put the wrong number i can't cancel it and i didn't get the refund A TOTAL SCAM,1

I've shared my account details 3 times and everytime i get a message that refund has failed. Customer care doesn't know anything and cannot help you out. I DO NOT recommended to buy anything from tira. Just see their response on my comment and you'll understand better about their customer care,1
